        <p>To begin the task I decided to cover would be how to add different screen sizes
            This is because if you can figure this out it allows you can specify break points, color, fonts and more.
                This is what setting the screen sizes should look like.</p>
                <img src="screensize.png">
                <p>As the code above shows we set a series of different screen sizes which can allow easier customization in the furture.
                    By doing something this simple it will allow us to stop having to write CSS at each breakpoint. We all know how annoying CSS is 
                    so we should try and spare ourselves the trouble. The code below is the example of how we can use the above code to change each screen size.
